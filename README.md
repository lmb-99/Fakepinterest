# FakePinterest
In this project I made my own version of Pinterest. Everything was done using PyCharm.

# How It's Made: 
**Tech used:** Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

I have used Flask to do the backend part and I received CSS style sheet and HTML sheet and I have integrated it onto my code. For user authentication I used bcrypt.

# How To Run The Project:
Open the project folder in a code editor and run the file 'main.py'
